NAME
    SVN::Log - Extract change logs from a Subversion server.

SYNOPSIS
      use SVN::Log;

      my $revs = SVN::Log::retrieve ("svn://host/repos", 1);

      print Dumper ($revs);

DESCRIPTION
    SVN::Log retrieves and parses the commit logs from Subversion
    repositories.

VARIABLES
  $FORCE_COMMAND_LINE_SVN
    If this is true SVN::Log will use the command line svn client instead of
    the subversion perl bindings when it needs to access the repository.

FUNCTIONS
  retrieve
      retrieve ('svn://host/repos', $start_rev, $end_rev);

    Retrieve one or more log messages from a repository. If a second
    revision is not specified, the revision passed will be retrieved,
    otherwise the range of revisions from $start_rev to $end_rev will be
    retrieved.

    The revisions are returned as a reference to an array of hashes. Each
    hash contains the following keys:

    revision
        The number of the revision.

    paths
        A hashref indicating the paths modified by this revision. Each key
        is the name of the path modified in this revision. The value is an
        "svn_log_changed_path_t" object from SVN::Core, which allows you to
        determine what happened to this path. See the description of the
        "action()", "copyfrom_path()", and "copyfrom_rev()" methods in
        SVN::Core.

    author
        The author of the revision.

    date
        The date of this revision.

    message
        The commit message from this revision.

    Alternatively, you can pass retrieve a hash containing the repository,
    start and end revisions, and a callback function which will be called
    for each revision, like this:

      retrieve ({ repository => "svn://svn.example.org/repos",
                  start => 1,
                  end => 2,
                  callback => sub { print @_; } });

    The callback will be passed a reference to a hash of paths modified, the
    revision, the author, the date, and the message associated with the
    revision.

    See SVN::Log::Index for the cannonical example of how to do this.
