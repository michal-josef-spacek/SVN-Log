NAME
    SVN::Log - Extract change logs from a Subversion server.

SYNOPSIS
      use SVN::Log;

      my $revs = SVN::Log::retrieve ("svn://host/repos", 1);

      print Dumper ($revs);

DESCRIPTION
    SVN::Log retrieves and parses the commit logs from Subversion
    repositories.

VARIABLES
  $FORCE_COMMAND_LINE_SVN
    If this is true SVN::Log will use the command line svn client instead of
    the subversion perl bindings when it needs to access the repository.

FUNCTIONS
  retrieve
      retrieve('svn://host/repos', $start_rev, $end_rev);

    Retrieve one or more log messages from a repository. If a second
    revision is not specified, the revision passed will be retrieved,
    otherwise the range of revisions from $start_rev to $end_rev will be
    retrieved.

    One or both of $start_rev and $end_rev may be given as "HEAD", meaning
    the most recent (youngest) revision in the repository. To retrieve all
    the log messages in the repository.

      retrieve('svn://host/repos', 1, 'HEAD');

    To do the same thing, but retrieve the log messages in reverse order
    (i.e., most recent log message first):

      retrieve('svn://host/repos, 'HEAD', 1);

    The revisions are returned as a reference to an array of hashes. Each
    hash contains the following keys:

    revision
        The number of the revision.

    paths
        A hashref indicating the paths modified by this revision. Each key
        is the name of the path modified in this revision. The value is a
        reference to another hash, with the following possible keys.

        action
            The activity that happened to this path. One of "A", "M", or
            "D", for "Added", "Modified", or "Deleted" respectively. This
            key is always present.

        copyfrom_path
            If the action was "A" or "M" then this path may have been copied
            from another path in the repository. If it was then this key
            contains the path in the repository that the file was originally
            copied from.

        copyfrom_rev
            If "copyfrom_path" is set then this value contains the revision
            that the path in "copyfrom_path" was copied from.

    author
        The author of the revision. May legitimately be undefined if the
        repository allows unauthenticated commits (e.g., over WebDAV).

    date
        The date of this revision.

    message
        The commit message from this revision.

    Alternatively, you can pass "retrieve()" a hash containing the
    repository, start and end revisions, and a callback function which will
    be called for each revision, like this:

      retrieve ({ repository => "svn://svn.example.org/repos",
                  start => 1,
                  end => 2,
                  callback => sub { print @_; } });

    The callback will be passed a reference to a hash of paths modified, the
    revision, the author, the date, and the message associated with the
    revision.

    See SVN::Log::Index for the cannonical example of how to do this.
